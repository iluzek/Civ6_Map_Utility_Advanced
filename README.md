- It will allow you to go outside of normal settings to facilitate mods that increase number of civilizations, city states, beliefs etc.
- It will also allow you to unlock map sizes greater than defaults. They might or might not work, depending on how high you set it up.
Once in game you can find your new map size in selection screen.

> **Removal map sizes:**  
To completely remove all custom map sizes:  
Go to "Sid Meiers Civilization VI" directory and remove following directories.  
"/Base/Assets/Configuration/Data/Civ6_Map_Utility/Map_Sizes/"  
"/Base/Assets/Gameplay/Data/Civ6_Map_Utility/Map_Sizes/"  
  
To remove single map size go to the same directories and remove files:  

- MAP_SIZE_NAME_MapSizes.xml
- MAP_SIZE_NAME_Maps.xml
  
**Removal map scripts:**  
To completely remove all custom map scripts:  
Go to "Sid Meiers Civilization VI" directory and remove following directory.  
"/Base/Assets/Configuration/Data/Civ6_Map_Utility/Map_Scripts/"  
  
To remove single map script go to the same directory and remove files:  

- SCRIPT_NAME.lua,
- SCRIPT_NAME_MapSettings.xml  

- SCRIPT_NAME_StandardMaps.xml
**Troubleshooting:  
**  
> **Settings Problems:**  
Minimum, Maximum and Default values are described within TOOLTIPS- they can be read by hovering mouse over text.  
Experimental settings need to be tested by community and can be enhanced with use of other mods.  
If your game crashes, try different settings. I am unable to test all of them.  
  
I ask you guys to help figure out what works and what does not.  
  
Example:  
1. My game crashes to desktop for maps that are 170x170, however this might not be the case for everyone. Map size of 165 x 170 loaded for me just fine so it might be memory allocation limit or something else. (It does take long time to load on bigger maps - Recommend to disable barbarians on big maps.)  
  
2. Map sizes are not the same as map scripts - map scripts determine spawning of the world and as such, there is no guarantee that the map size selected will work well with your script map and player number.  
You might load the game and see no players or starting position as game was unable to find a suitable place for you to spawn. Reloading the map/script usually works, however this again I cannot predict.  
  
  
> **Support:**  
If you are able to provide additional information regarding values and ranges.  
If you have an idea how to improve the application - visually or functionally.  
Please share it with myself and other community members within Utility's Discussion page.
